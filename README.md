Sections: 
The hero section of my website is very simple. But it is where I first learned how to add an image, in this case, my personalized icon, and a background color. 

My bio and hobbies section, before changing my original outline, taught me how to format lists, which I incorporated in my lit section. But now as I final draft, I have turned the list into small paragraphs to further introduce myself and talk about my hobbies.

The gallery section, as simple as it looks, gave me a hard time. I struggled with centering the images and resizing them so they could fix the screen better. But in the end, I was able to accomplish my goal and add multiple hover effects to this section. 

The literature section was another difficult section for me. Especially when adding the drop-caps. But after revisiting this section I was able to make it something I am proud of. I realized that when creating drop-caps less can be more and look just as good. I also have no difficulty with inserting and positioning images in this section, because of all the work I had to do to get it down-packed in the gallery section. 

Utilizing different screen sizes was another challenge for me. However, I tried my best to work through it because I understand the importance of having a versatile website. 

Overall my best struggle was adding a hamburger icon that toggles the menu open and closed. But in the end, it has become the thing I am the most proud of and it works amazingly. 

While working with vs code for the first time, I had many struggles. But it has left me with valuable skills that will aid me in future classes. Not only did I learn a new trait but I learned that just because something is hard does not mean you should give up on it. I never gave up and now I have created a website that I am proud of. 

Color scheme: 
For my color scheme, I utilized two different color palettes that complement each well. At first, I wanted my theme to be different shades of blues and tans to create a calming feeling when browsing my page. However, my website ended up being different shades of tans and pinks instead. While it is different from what I had originally wanted, I am still very pleased with how it turned out. My background color is #E2DBD7. My main text color is #955863. And I also incorporated the colors #EAA1AE and white. In my opinion, all the colors go together well and still add a calmness to my website.
